    <h1 class="maintxt">The curse of the Crypt</h1>
<h2 class="maintxt">For years the village of Arkangel has been overshadowed by the crypt which was once the neighboring village of Anchorage. It was graced by a source of much wealth known as the uranium core and was guarded by a guild of wizards. As they were mining this magical core it brought with it meagre stat buffs to all armor it was put on. Anchorage was attacked by a powerful dragon taming cult called the blood warriors, who had already destroyed much of the archipelago and defeated the guild of wizards. Jerry, the only survivor, fled to Arkangel. They were power hungry and too greedy. They mined too deep into the core. The core went critical and exploded turning purple and covering the land with writhing energy which still is there today. The island was corrupted and turned into the crypt and the uranium was infected and mutated into the form of creatures who would drop the precious resource. The blood warrior leaders were infused with so much power that they turned into their respective dragon. One for iron, one for gold, one for diamond and the leader formed into a netherite dragon. It was said that the netherite dragon was so powerful that he caused huge meteors to come from the sky. The island has since been abandoned, but a few brave villagers still summon dragons and farm uranium. So some villagers have set up a black market in the village which sells dragon artifacts for you to kill the dragons and find the blood warriors’ technology as well as killing the uranium warriors still in the mines to collect the special resource and return to Jerry in return for his technology.</h2>
<h1 class="maintxt">A guide to the town of Arkangel</h1>
<h2 class="maintxt">This will tell you everything you need to know about Arkangel. The blacksmith is a place where you can get some nice cheap early game weapons, but they’re only iron so if you get there early it can give you a nice boost. The Jerry shop was set up by Jerry when he fled Anchorage because he wanted to regain some of his uranium. He will ask you to return it in exchange for dope tech. The black market is under one of the market stands and is where you can find dragon eggs, but be careful: those guys are pretty shady. The library is where you can find info on the town and its history in a wide variety of books. The tavern is where you can find potions, much more advanced than the types you peasants brew.</h2>
<h1 class="maintxt">Dope tech</h1>
<h2 class="maintxt">Dope tech is technology which was forged in the furnaces of Oldcliff during the golden age of trade and traded all around the archipelago before the blood warriors came and corrupted it all. After the blood warriors destroyed Oldcliff they stopped being produced and instead replaced by blood tech, primitive technology developed by the blood warriors (still much more advanced than your earthling tech). Jerry who had traded with Dope tech in exchange for his uranium had a lot of this Dope tech and was willing to exchange it in order to regain his uranium.</h2>
<h1 class="maintxt">The Drunken Steve</h1>
<h2 class="maintxt">The Drunken Steve is the best tavern in what is left of the archipelago. The tavern isn't just for drinking but for pioneering new brewing techniques. It was found by adding uranium to the bottles to amplify their effect massively. But it takes expert skills to make them remotely safe to drink. The Drunken Tavern used to trade with Anchorage so that if they would give the tavern uranium, they could harness the power source and use it to amplify potions and would give a portion of it back to Anchorage. With supplies running low they have stopped pioneering and instead use their skills to brew potions they've already learnt as they do not have the supply of uranium to test their recipes. If you could find enough they may even  start experimenting again.</h2>
<h1 class="maintxt">The History of the Archipelago</h1>
<h2 class="maintxt">The Archipelago was once a great trading hub, building villages far more advanced than the Netherknights or the Endonians. For years the Qui Caelum (sky people) have been pioneering new technology. While they were in a golden age, the Netherknights were fighting and Endonians rebuilding, and the earth consisted of only tribal villages. Great villages started appearing like Arkangel which was known for its potions, Oldcliff, known for its tech, and Azmar, the protector of the archipelago, a great fort island and the second largest island in the whole archipelago. There was a rumor of an underworld below the void of earth that was ruled by Hades Demons, but many people didn't believe it. Then the Blood Warriors came: a dragon taming cult claiming they had overthrown Hades Demons and had left the Underworld in search for more resources. Then they attacked Azmar. It was a long battle and lasted for many years. When they finally defeated Azmar they swept through the Archipelago attacking any significant island leaving behind devastation. They had nearly destroyed all the most significant islands but they attacked Ozryn, the only city in the archipelago. This was the Qui Caelum’s last stand. Brewers from Arkangel and Forgers from Goldcrest teamed up with the warriors of Ozryn and defeated the Blood Warriors. But the Blood Warriors had left behind the corrupted islands of over two thirds of the Archipelago. The Archipelago may never recover.</h2>
