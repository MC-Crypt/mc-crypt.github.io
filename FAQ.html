    <h1 class="maintxt">How do I get to the crypt island</h1>
<h2 class="maintxt">First you will need to get the eye of enders to open the portal at spawn and you will arrive at the neighbouring village of Arkangel from there you will need to buy a key from the black-market dealer to unlock the bridge and arrive at the crypt island.</h2>
<h1 class="maintxt">How do i spawn a dragon </h1>
<h2 class="maintxt">You will need to contact the blacksmith where you can get a cheap dragon egg which spawns the first dragon this will drop dragon shards which you can combine with resources to unlock better dragons but dont go straight for the netherite dragon as it will overpower you and use the loot from previous dragons to help you fight vanila armour wont work.</h2>
